The Odin Store - An eCommerce Project

This is an e-Commerce/clothing store project, named after the Norse god, Odin. 
It is based on Python, Django, React JS, and Bootstrap. 
In this project, I’ve used React JS and Bootstrap for the front end and Python and Django for the back end. 
For designing parts, I’ve used Canva and for the payment gateway, I’ve used Braintree. 
It has some custom design products, which I designed in Canva, with a completely working payment gateway Braintree.
You can add products in Django Admin Panel with their image, name, description, size, price, category, and stock and they will show up on the website as Bootstrap Cards. 
I’ve used Postman for the API Testing and to test CRUD operations for this project.
